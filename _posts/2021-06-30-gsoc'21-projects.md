Hey everyone!. Today's blog is about the projects selected for GSoC and a little sneak peek of the projects.


## Microsoft Word Integration: 
We are working on a Word add-in that allows users to select and insert citations 
directly from the Word document. The JabRef Word Add-in can be used without having your reference manager open 
or even installed. All you need is your jabref account. Once you sign in to JabRef Word Addin, your JabRef 
library is downloaded from the cloud, and you can continue working on your document. JabRef word addin opens 
as a separate panel in Word alongside your document window. So your whole document remains in your view as you search, 
select and insert references.
